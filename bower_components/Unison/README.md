Unison.js
=========

Syncing named breakpoints across CSS, JS, and HTML.

Demo and more information [here](http://bjork24.github.io/Unison).

SASS Integration
================

Declare breakpoints and specify names in `_breakpoints.scss`

```scss
// declare breakpoints
$usn-x-small         : 200px;
$usn-small           : 400px;
$usn-small-medium    : 600px;
$usn-medium          : 800px;
$usn-large-medium    : 1000px;
$usn-large           : 1200px;
$usn-x-large         : 1400px;

// create sass list to pass media query data
// if a breakpoint name changes, remember to
// update it in the list below as well
$mq-sync:
  usn-x-small        $usn-x-small,
  usn-small          $usn-small,
  usn-small-medium   $usn-small-medium,
  usn-medium         $usn-medium,
  usn-large-medium   $usn-large-medium,
  usn-large          $usn-large,
  usn-x-large        $usn-x-large
;
```

LESS Integration
================

Declare breakpoints and specify names in `breakpoints.less`

```less
// declare breakpoints
@usn-x-small         : 200px;
@usn-small           : 400px;
@usn-small-medium    : 600px;
@usn-medium          : 800px;
@usn-large-medium    : 1000px;
@usn-large           : 1200px;
@usn-x-large         : 1400px;

// create list to pass media query data
// if a breakpoint name changes, remember to
// update it in the list below as well
@breakpoints: "usn-x-small @{usn-x-small}",
              "usn-small @{usn-small}",
              "usn-small-medium @{usn-small-medium}",
              "usn-medium @{usn-medium}",
              "usn-large-medium @{usn-large-medium}",
              "usn-large @{usn-large}",
              "usn-x-large @{usn-x-large}";

// you need to explicity tell LESS how many
// breakpoints you have
@number-of-breakpoints: 7;
```

Stylus Integration
==================

Declase breakpoints and specify names in `breakpoints.styl`

```styl
// declare breakpoints
$usn-x-small         = 200px
$usn-small           = 400px
$usn-small-medium    = 600px
$usn-medium          = 800px
$usn-large-medium    = 1000px
$usn-large           = 1200px
$usn-x-large         = 1400px

// create list to pass media query data
// if a breakpoint name changes, remember to
// update it in the list below as well
$mq-sync = usn-x-small        $usn-x-small,
           usn-small          $usn-small,
           usn-small-medium   $usn-small-medium,
           usn-medium         $usn-medium,
           usn-large-medium   $usn-large-medium,
           usn-large          $usn-large,
           usn-x-large        $usn-x-large
```

Manual Installation
===================

Include `unison.min.js` on your page:

`<script src="unison.min.js"></script>`

Verify everything is working by entering `Unison.fetch.all()` in the javascript 
console of your browser. If the CSS is not set up properly, or your page is 
missing the title tag, the returned value will be `null`.

Bower Installation
==================

If you're using Bower:

`bower install unison`

Then point to the script within the `bower_components` directory:

`<script src="bower_components/unison/js/unison.min.js"></script>`

The various preprocessor partials can be found in `bower_components/unison/css/`.

Comments conditional loading is implimented via Unison.
